    <h2>Ale</h2>
    <p>Hi. My name is Alexandra, but many friends call me Ale. I am married for almost 8 years, but we 
        don't have children yet. The picture is from our wedding because I don't like taking pictures. 
        We live in Sibiu, Romania. I like to read, cook and bake.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for almost 11 years. 
        My favorite scripture is in D&C 82:10 "I,the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say;but when ye do 
        not what I say, ye have no promise"</p>
